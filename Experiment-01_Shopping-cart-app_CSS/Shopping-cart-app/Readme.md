Shopping cart application where users can browse a catalog, add items to the cart, view their selected items, and check the total price. It also includes a logout option for managing user sessions.

Extensions Used:
HTML (.html) – Defines the webpage structure
CSS (.css) – Linked stylesheet () for formatting and layout
JavaScript (.js) – External script () to manage cart functionality.
Hyperlinks (.html) – Links to other pages:
 -Catalog (catalog.html) – Presumably displays available products.
 -Cart (cart.html) – Shows selected items.
 -Login (login.html) – Manages user authentication.
Meta Tags – Ensures proper character encoding and responsive behavior.

Possible Problems Faced:
-The cart system depends on a proper structure for storing and retrieving items. Without a database or a local storage mechanism, the cart might not persist across sessions.

-If  isn’t properly fetching or storing cart items, the display () and total price () may not update correctly.
